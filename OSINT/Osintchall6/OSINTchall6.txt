We have reason to believe that a particular company, TECHNOLOGY SERVICES LIMITED is complicit in a case we are investigating.

To gain a better understanding of the size and scale of this company, we need you to find out the AMOUNT OF CASH currently held by them.

We've attached a document we acquired from hacking one of their laptops; hopefully this will help you find this information?

Thank you for your continued support.

E.g. if the AMOUNT OF CASH was Â£94,200, for the flag you'd enter: 94.2

Flag:- 102.3
