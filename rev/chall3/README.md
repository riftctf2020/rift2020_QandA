1. you can add the above description for the challenge in the ctf task description
2. the players are only supposed to have the files in the 'src' folder
3. their task is to reverse the crackme.js and find the correct password
4. with the 'src' folder there is a solve.py and it uses z3 to find the correct password for the crackme
5. Have FUN reversing ;)
